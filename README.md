It's Simple Todo

A Todo App that allows a user to track progress on their daily tasks. Drag and drop cards, similar to Trello, but with only four columns... Todo, Active, Done, and archived. 

Future plans are to implement a Google Calendar API so that events can be saved on a user's Google Calendar. By default notifications can be added to send automatic emails when a task needs to be completed.
